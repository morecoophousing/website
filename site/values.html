            <h2 id="start" aria-role="heading">Guiding Principles</h2>

            <h3 id="cooperative">Cooperative</h3> 

            <div class="text-block">
                We believe in and participate in the cooperative movement as it exists in housing and other co-ops. We participate in co-op federations that relate directly to our work (e.g. CHFT, CHFC, NASCO) and support co-op federations that advance radical work which we support (e.g. CWCF, USWCF, etc). We agree to and follow the same <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity?_ga=2.163508156.1660896719.1622518746-308026495.1622518746">seven principles</a>, as defined by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) that co-ops around the world follow.  We understand ourselves as part of the progressive wing of the co-op movement, challenging the apolitical and liberal status-quo and continue building on the radical socialist tradition of our movement. 
            </div>

            <h3 id="collective">Collective Organizing</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                Together, we can practice anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and anti-colonial ways of relating to one another. We recognize that we live in a society with power dynamics and that those power dynamics can and often do get replicated in our relationships, communities, and organizing. We seek to organize in a way that flattens as many of these power dynamics as possible using consensus based decision making and transformative justice practice. We empower community members by actively inviting and making space for marginalized members to participate and be heard.
            </div>

            <h3 id="housing">Housing Justice</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                We seek housing justice for those beyond our collective. We support broader movements to legalize housing, provide public housing and decriminalize houselessness. We believe in building structures that equitably redistribute resources within and without our community and in investing our own resources into growing the stock of affordable community housing.
            </div>

            <h3 id="climate">Climate Justice</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                Building and zoning decisions should be made with a climate justice lens, prioritizing active transport and efficient resource use. Housing should facilitate sustainable lifestyles (such as gardening and resource conservation) and should be part of a broader community approach to climate justice.
            </div>

            <h3 id="indigenous">Indigenous Sovereignty</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                The decommodification of land and its return to Indigenous peoples, governance, and lifeways are foundational to the healing and liberation of all communities. As people living on occupied lands, we are compelled to resist the ongoing project of colonization that is the Canadian state. We seek accountability with peoples Indigenous to these lands, namely the Anishinaabek, Haudenosaunee, Wendat/Wyandot, urban Indigenous peoples, and others recorded and unrecorded. We recognize that the cooperative housing movement is a flawed and incomplete approach to decolonization insofar as it is invested in settler colonial regimes of private property, and we therefore understand current models of cooperative housing as an intermediate step in a broader process of decolonization and Indigenous resurgence. We aim to instrumentalize cooperative housing in order to both reallocate resources (such as money, land, and power) to Indigenous peoples as well as to build the capacity of our communities to fight colonialism and all systems of oppression.
            </div>

            <h2>Vision</h2>

            <h3 id="community">Housing is community-oriented</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                We believe that housing is not just a place to live but also the basis of a community. Strong communities spend time together and build relationships of trust, solidarity, and mutual aid.
            </div>

            <h3 id="equitable">Housing is equitable</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                We believe that housing should be constructed with the understanding that all should have access. Specifically, one’s social position and identity (e.g. race, class, education, immigration status, language, gender, sexuality, ability, or age) should not be barriers to accessing safe and supportive housing that meets people’s needs. Equitable communities are diverse in membership and actively resist all forms of oppression, including patriarchy, capitalism, and colonialism.
            </div>

            <h3 id="secure">Housing is secure</h3>

            <div class="text-block">
                We believe in removing financial barriers so that people can access housing that is secure in the long term. Housing is genuinely affordable, and it is not motivated by profit or market speculation. We combat gentrification by collaborating with existing members of the community in order to safeguard community assets including protecting existing community members’ housing.
